# Pomodoro Timer with a React Native / Redux approach.

## The project - Pomodoro Timer
For this project, I'll be implementing a Pomodoro timer. This timer will help
people trying to use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
It will vibrate and play a custom song (just on breaks - not yet implemented)  to tell you when to take breaks or resume working, based on some
determined values.
